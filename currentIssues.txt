1. scanning not working properly because direction not updated in time (they take previous direction after first time check)
    --> can possibly take from font render portion for direction 
2. scanCheck taking the wrong corner of the car for obstacles 
    --> will need to create different scanCheck locations depending on where the obstacle is facing
    --> change DIRECTION.NORTH such that target location moves down 2 BLOCKS
    --> change DIRECTION.EAST such that target location moves left 2 BLOCKS
