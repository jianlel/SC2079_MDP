1. timeCounter and scanCounter not being printed out properly on the screen (could be due to concatenation error, not very sure)

How to properly read the robot:
Command s = Car went STRAIGHT FORWARD
Command b = Car went STRAIGHT BACKWARD
Command d = Car went RIGHT
Command u = Car went LEFT
Command w = Car went REVERSE RIGHT 
Command v = Car went REVERSE LEFT
# Command OR = Car went RIGHT on the spot 
# Command OL = Car went LEFT on the spot
